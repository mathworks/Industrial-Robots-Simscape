This repository of industrial robot models for use with [Simscape Multibody](https://www.mathworks.com/products/simscape-multibody.html) includes mobile and manipulator robots. It has examples that help you:

* **Import URDF files** using MATLAB to create models
* Perform **kinematic and dynamic analyses**
* Integrate **electric drives and control algorithms** in [Simulink](https://www.mathworks.com/products/simulink.html)
* Leverage Robotics System Toolbox for **[path and trajectory planning](https://www.mathworks.com/products/robotics.html#robalg)**.

Run file startup_sm_industrial_robots.m to get started.
